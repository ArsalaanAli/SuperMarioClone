The goal of the game is to traverse the level, bypass enemies, and collect as many coins and powerups as possible, all while minimizing the time to complete the level. Coins and powerups offer advantages in the game and allow the player to gain lives or gain special abilities. Enemies can be eliminated by jumping on their heads. Collision with an enemy will result in a player losing a life. A player will lose a life when they fall out of bounds, and the level will be restarted.
